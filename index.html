        <p>Evaluating Internal Model Knowledge Retrieval and Hallucinations</p>

            <h2>Task Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The objective of this task is to evaluate the effectiveness of generative models in producing factually accurate information. Participants will submit models, and the task organizers will provide a benchmarking framework designed to assess these modelsâ€™ ability to respond to medical domain-specific queries with factual accuracy. Using a structured set of atomic question-answer pairs, the task will measure how well the models retrieve factually correct information.
                The benchmarking framework will pose well-defined, atomic questions to the models, requiring a single, precise response. These questions will assess the model's knowledge about fundamental medical concepts and its ability to avoid common pitfalls like hallucination or factual inaccuracies. Scoring will be based on the precision of the answers and will involve partial, full, or negative points based on accuracy. Full points will be awarded for exact or semantically equivalent answers, while incorrect answers or repeated factual errors on the same concept will result in negative scores.
                This task focuses purely on fact retrieval and does not assess reasoning abilities like commonsense reasoning, temporal understanding, or logical consistency.

            <h2>Datasets</h2>
            <p>The dataset provided for this task is a collection of factual, atomic question-answer pairs grounded in the medical domain, specifically curated to align with the knowledge level of a General Practitioner (GP) Medical Doctor. These question-answer pairs cover core medical concepts such as procedures, conditions, drugs, and diagnostics.</p>

                    <em>"Step 1: Fatigue and shortness of breath are symptoms of anemia. Step 2: High MCV indicates macrocytic anemia. Step 3: Macrocytic anemia is commonly caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Step 4: Conclude megaloblastic anemia due to likely vitamin B12 deficiency."</em>

                                <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> If the model returns exactly this answer, full points are awarded.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Full points will also be awarded if the model returns an answer that is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, even if phrased differently (e.g., using synonyms).</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                            <ul>

                            <ul>

                                <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Since the model missed the aspect of "minimally invasive," partial points will be awarded for providing a partially correct answer.</li>
